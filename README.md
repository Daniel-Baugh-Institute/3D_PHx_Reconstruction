Title: Mouse Liver Microarchitecture 3D reconstruction in MATLAB
Author: Justin Melunis, Ph.D.

About: This repository provides the code to recreate the analysis described in the our forthcoming paper. 

To run:

This repository is designed to create a GUI application within the program MATLAB 2018b.
The application analyzes images obtained from confocal microscopy z-stacks, stained according to the protocol described in Hammad et al, 2014.
The images analyzed in our work can be found in the folder labeled "IFADO_PHx_stacks".

To run the application and replicate our analysis, create a clone of this repository, and use MATLAB 2018b (or later version) to launch the extension "appdesigner", and select "Liver_Segmentation_App.mlapp".

For instructions on how to navigate the GUI app, please refer to supplementary files of our paper.
